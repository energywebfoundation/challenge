# About EW Innovation Challenge
## Introduction
To celebrate the one-year anniversary of the [Energy Web Chain’s launch](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341), Energy Web is proud to announce an open call for innovative ideas to support our nonprofit mission to decarbonize the global energy sector via open-source, digital, decentralized technologies. Our ambition is bold—[10 gigatons of additional decarbonization](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digitalization-means-decarbonization-4e4b1af21d63)—and we can’t do it alone.

Through 26 June 2020, interested organizations are invited to submit proposals on their ideas. To be considered, proposals must describe **what** you intend to build, **how** it accelerates Energy Web’s mission, and a **high-level plan** to deliver on the idea.

The ideas should be built upon our established [Energy Web Decentralized Operating System](https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/) (EW-DOS). EW-DOS leverages the [Energy Web Chain](https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/) and allows for new energy applications to go live and create tangible impact.

## Who should apply?
We encourage students, entrepreneurs, application developers, startups, corporate innovation teams, and regulators from any sector to participate in this challenge.

## What are we looking for?

The call for ideas is very open-ended. Our team is interested in reviewing any and all proposals to support Energy Web’s nonprofit mission. 

Your application needs to answer the questions in the [template doc](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/challenge/blob/master/applications/application-template.md), present your idea concisely (the total document excluding figures should be less than 5 pages in length), and outline a realistic plan of action to bring your idea to life. (Note: you do not need to actually build your idea to take part in the Innovation Challenge).

We have also identified several concepts and ideas that we believe would be of great value to the Energy Web ecosystem. We encourage interested parties to consider submitting ideas in these areas as well as their own concepts:

### Tech stack enhancements:
* Decentralized digital identity (DID) library [integration with additional DID methods](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry/tree/development/packages/did-resolver-interface)
* DID resolver for [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/) and/or [Kilt](https://kilt.io/)
* Energy Web Chain analytics, monitoring, and visualizations (e.g., dashboards)
* Transaction relay server (example projects which can be used as inspiration: such as [Gnosis transaction relay](https://gnosis-safe.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/services/relay.html) and [Rockside](https://docs.rockside.io/))
* Audits for EW technologies (e.g. the DID Library or Origin)

### Applications & use cases:
* EW Origin integrations with legacy energy attribute certificate registries
* EW Flex integrations with legacy IT systems
* Enable retail supplier switching with DID
* dApps to improve grid resiliency based on EW-DOS

## Innovation Challenge Evaluation
The Evaluation Committee will consist of 2 members of the Energy Web team and 1 member from the Energy Web community. Depending on application submissions, we may expand the Evaluation Committee to meet additional needs

The applications will be examined holistically; however special attention of the Evaluation Committee will be focused toward a predefined set of evaluation criteria:
* Usefulness and uniqueness of the innovative solution;
* Compatibility with EW Chain;
* Commercialization potential;
* Team credentials and ability of the team to deliver;

# Application Process
## Submissions are open source
To be eligible to compete in the Innovation Challenge, all applications must be submitted publicly to this Innovation Challenge Repository.

Having a transparent and open source application process means that others will be able to read and may even use your ideas as inspiration for their own work or submissions. When evaluating submissions, if we find that two are very similar we will take into consideration which was submitted first.

## Steps to apply
1. Create Your GitHub Application
    1. Fork this repository
    2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application-template.md. In other words: In the GitHub web interface, you need to create a new file and copy the content of the application-template.md inside the new file. Don't change the template file directly!
    3. Rename the file "your_project_name.md".
    4. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
2. Submit your GitHub Application
    1. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
    2. Sign off on the [terms and conditions](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/challenge/blob/master/src/Terms_%26_Conditions.md) presented by claassistantio as a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You might need to reload the pull request to see the comment by claassistantio.
    3. The Evaluation committee can issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
    4. The GitHub application is submitted when the committee approves the pull request, the terms and conditions have been agreed to, and all requested changes are all addressed.
3. Fill out and submit this [Ancillary Form](https://share.hsforms.com/1275EVu9YSPW8SY2D0KOw8w37vj2)
4. Your submission is complete!
    1. Just make sure to complete all prior steps by the submission deadline: **June 19, 2020**
5. Review
    1. The Energy Web team will review proposals and award up to three winning proposals with grants in Energy Web Tokens (EWT) with a maximum value of 5,000 EWT per grant.
    2. The winners will be announced by June 26, 2020
