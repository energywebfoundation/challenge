# Energy Web Innovation Challenge Proposal
* **Project Name**: SolarDAO
* **Project Proposer GitHub**: https://github.com/adradr
* **Energy Web Chain Payment Address**: 0xb600409101aB33d1a7DF8aF526a2eFBC72e475BB

## Project Description

Please take a look at our [presentation](https://github.com/adradr/challenge/blob/master/applications/Solar%20DAO%20Pitch.pdf) and [onepager](https://github.com/adradr/challenge/blob/master/applications/SolarDAO%20One%20pager.pdf) attached.

### Challenge
We believe the pre-eminent challenge of humankind is global warming, which is characterized by a high degree of complexity and unprecedented need for cross-border and local collaboration. To tackle global warming, we must decarbonize our economy with power generation from renewable sources. The challenge is to make renewable energy accessible for everyone in a decentralized and autonomous way, which in part fails due to the lack of innovative toolkits for problem solving within new models of collaboration.
### Solution
Our solution to the challenge is the SolarDAO platform, which enables its members to access renewable energy through a DAO running on EnergyWebChain – an Ethereum based blockchain. By leveraging the wisdom of the crowd the platform creates a consensus based decision making tool/process. This enables the community to effectively collaborate localy and co- finance the community’s renewable energy assets whilst ensuring proper efficiency, governance and trust through the utilization of smart contracts.
### Features
There are five main features the SolarDAO platform aims to create. Advanced analytics helps to monitor consumption and generation with a visual map of the energy community. Co-financing function enables members to take ownership of the local generation. The decision making features enables a DAO-like operation, while education and gamification targets to form the demand-side flexibility by rewarding consumption optimization.

## EW-DOS integration
SolarDAO aims to leverage EW-DOS capabilities in the following ways:
- Smart metering data would be acquired using EW DID registry referencing
- EW-Origin would be leveraged to issue green energy certificates based on the electricity generated by the co-financed renewable energy sourcers (RES)
- DAO members could claim some amount of these certificates, but never more than the energy they used
- The excess or unclaimed energy from the co-financed RES then can be traded on the EW-Origin marketplace, or in case of increased energy demand, green energy could be bought from the marketplace
- DAO and co-finance related custom smart contracts would be deployed to EWC
