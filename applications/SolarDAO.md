# Energy Web Innovation Challenge Proposal
* **Project Name**: SolarDAO
* **Project Proposer GitHub**: https://github.com/adradr
* **Energy Web Chain Payment Address**: 

## Project Description
### Challenge
We believe the pre-eminent challenge of humankind is global warming, which is characterized by a high degree of complexity and unprecedented need for cross-border and local collaboration. To tackle global warming, we must decarbonize our economy with power generation from renewable sources. The challenge is to make renewable energy accessible for everyone in a decentralized and autonomous way, which in part fails due to the lack of innovative toolkits for problem solving within new models of collaboration.
### Solution
Our solution to the challenge is the SolarDAO platform, which enables its members to access renewable energy through a DAO* running on EnergyWebChain – an Ethereum based blockchain. By leveraging the wisdom of the crowd the platform creates a consensus based decision making tool/process. This enables the community to effectively collaborate localy and co- finance the community’s renewable energy assets whilst ensuring proper efficiency, governance and trust through the utilization of smart contracts.
### Features
There are five main features the SolarDAO platform aims to create. Advanced analytics helps to monitor consumption and generation with a visual map of the energy community. Co-financing function enables members to take ownership of the local generation. The decision making features enables a DAO-like operation, while education and gamification targets to form the demand-side response by rewarding consumption optimization.
