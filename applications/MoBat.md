## Project Description

### Background and Motivation

Smart cities have become a popular concept and it is expected that intelligent and sustainable cities will form a central pillar for achieving resource efficiency and sustainability worldwide [11]. Because of its potential to address a variety of negative effects from urban sprawl (e.g. congestion, CO2 emissions) and industrial development (e.g. air and soil pollution), the concept, "smart city" has almost become omnipresent both in academia and in policy circles [1-3]. Large cities contribute to 60–80% of the global energy consumption and about the same proportion of CO2 emissions [4], while 91% of the world’s population live in places where air quality exceeds World Healthcare Organisation’s guideline limits [5]. Furthermore, most of the increase in global greenhouse gasses over the past 150 years was caused by human activities, such as, electricity production, supply chain industry and more. However, transportation is seen as the main source of greenhouse gas emissions [6]. The greenhouse gas emissions from transportation come primarily from the fossil fuel consumption of vehicles, trucks, ships, trains and aircrafts. Thus, smart mobility is considered a strategic pillar for the development of a smart city. Smart mobility promotes sustainable mobility, ensures connectivity, and enhances transport systems, at the same time, making parking management processes more efficient.

The connection of smart mobility to smart energy grids, particularly, when it comes to the necessary charging infrastructure, is a key topic within the energy sector. It allows for concepts such as the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as versatile electric power or energy storage as a response to power demands. The proliferation of EVs, has led decision makers to view them both as a grid burden and as a resource, based on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) principle [7]. Electric vehicles can act as a mobile device for storage and provide grid support based on periodic and Distributed Energy Resources (DER). Even though EVs are becoming increasingly popular, there are some practical barriers that yet remain. Constrained battery capacity, limited number of charging stations, the distribution of the latter, as well as, long re-charging cycles are some of the barriers for the mass adoption of EVs. Some of the key challenges that affect EVs adoption are summarized as follows:

* *Battery expense:* The price of the battery is a major obstacle for electric car adoption. What tends to make it far more challenging is that, at around eight years, this expensive part of the EV needs to be repaired or replaced. Instead, traditional car drivers don't really need to repair their (relatively cheap) gas tanks in petrol or diesel vehicles that frequently.
* *Recharge time:* In reality EVs require significant time to completely recharge, this is considered another obstacle facing the adoption of EVs, besides range anxiety. An EV requires approximately 4-6 hours, probably even 8, to recharge a fully discharged EV. This can lead to major concerns especially during long-distance journeys; where the drivers require more time to complete their journeys.
* *Charging infrastructure:* In United Kingdom the average distance between two electric car charging stations/ points is about 3.5 miles, which is approximately three times the distance between current petrol/diesel fuelling stations. The fact that this is the “average” is what makes the situation worse and some under-developed countries - in terms of e-mobility- have a gap of even more [12].

To sum up, EVs have a significant short driving range which is currently limited by inadequate battery technology, that ultimately jeopardizes efficiency, comfort, and reliability. Moreover, the availability of charging stations is low with many distributed haphazardly [8]. EV users are often facing the anxiety of battery power exhaustion, especially in cases where there is no charging station accessible when needed (e.g. in long distance commutes).  Long distance routes should be carefully scheduled beforehand to ensure that charging stations are available throughout the route. 

In addition to the use of charging stations portable, light-weight battery, that provides on-demand charging could be used as a solution to the currently established charging infrastructure. Several studies [9, 10] highlight that the EV battery charges are viewed primarily as a static charge, and the batteries' practical device behaviour during the charging process is usually overlooked. Thus, a model for understanding the charging profile of each EVs is required for better evaluating the effect on the distribution system.

Even though EV charging technology solutions are progressing rapidly, smart grids and EVs could use an aggregator to manage and control the consumption and generation of energy, leading to increased risk of a mediator getting misled. This proposal suggests that blockchain technology with the adoption of smart contracts, could lead to a new spectrum of dynamic charging models and pricing decisions. Blockchain based applications, in combination with smart contracts, could potentially allow people to share their personal EV chargers with everyone. Peer to Peer (P2P) EV charging systems, can be used and in this case individuals can act as prosumers (i.e. producer and consumer at the same time) to exchange energy. In return, the battery owners can earn some rewards through an incentivised model (i.e.  EWT energy tokens) from their idle chargers by increasing their use with discharging the energy back to the grid or stations. We believe that the adoption of blockchains adoption can be used as an enabler for new charging schemes based on the P2P idea. This new category of charging schemes will greatly increase the amount of available charging locations and ultimately reduce anxiety ranges and encourage higher EVs adoption.


### Concept and Methodology 
The MoBat proposal, aims to deliver a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for enabling a smart, distributed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled P2P network for mobile batteries for e-scooters. Specifically, MoBat will deliver a blockchain enabled P2P network consisting of: (i) an innovative portable charging battery, (ii) e-scooters that comprise all EV services, and (iii) AI-smart contracts that will automate the charging process and facilitate the interactions between the portable e-scooter batteries and the grid. The MoBat approach consists of the portable battery, e-scooter and smart contracts. The MoBat proposal aims to offer enhanced energy storage and demand services to the energy grid in order to enable e-scooters (and any kind of EVs) to become transactive energy components.  In this direction, MoBat will exploit the blockchain technology, and specifically the Energy Web Chain (EWC), as a key underlying infrastructure ensuring that data contribution, sharing, exchange, use and processing will follow e-scooter drivers’ consent and will be fully secure and optimized for different stakeholders in a smart mobility ecosystem.

As depicted in Figure 1, mobile e-scooter batteries are plugged and un-plugged between e-scooters and wall-mounted points, to enable charging anywhere and anytime. Due to the light-weight design of the portable battery, the e-scooter drivers can take the battery with them, and plug it in any wall-mounted point – which is part of the MoBat ecosystem (to be developed on EWC nodes). The exchange of energy is enabled by the P2P network in a smart way, incentivizing users to earn Energy Web Tokens (EWT). Each e-scooter is registered on the EWC, holding a wallet with EWT. One wallet for the driver interacting with its mobile application and one representing the e-scooter itself. Due to the plug-n-play nature of the battery, the energy exchange supports all possible transactions, including energy transfer from the battery to local buildings (and vice versa) as well as from the local building towards the smart grid (and vice versa). Each portable battery is able to support energy services, using EWT executing all the associated smart contracts for supporting energy selling, energy savings, local demand response, EV charging, etc. Moreover, AI agents will be incorporated, to allow smart contracts, on top of the MoBat network, to automatically detect other batteries with similar characteristics, in nearby geographical places, and propose potential energy transactions. Additionally, the blockchain enabled smart contracts would take advantage of AI and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities, in order to transform the portable battery into an ad-hoc Virtual Storage Plant (VSP) while automatically interact with the energy market (i.e., the creation of a marketplace). Specifically, the portable e-scooter battery will be charged during off-peak periods (e.g. at night when the e-scooter is idle), pay off-grid electricity rates with EWT and then use the stored energy during peak periods. The above-mentioned AI-agents will constantly monitor the e-scooter’s driver behaviour in order to provide personalized charging profiles towards the dedicated smart contract and execute the most suitable policies. In this way, every battery can learn, adapt, sense and interact with the smart grid, by adapting the smart contract functionalities.

### Use Case Scenario
MoBat seeks to enable the set-up and operation of a smart connected mobility network, a holistic offering covering: (i) the portable e-scooter battery, (ii) a smart contract enabled blockchain network, through EWC, and (iii) an AI module for enabling efficient and effective charging profiles; personalized to each e-scooter driver. Figure 2 illustrates a high-level view of a potential use case scenario for the MoBat network and ecosystem. The e-scooter driver moves around a (smart) city and plugs-in the portable battery to any place or building. The battery, interacts with the established smart contracts to establish the charging process using the underlined blockchain network, taking decisions triggered by AI agents. According to personalized needs, when the battery is charged, or when the user wants to abort, the e-scooter ends the energy transfer, and as a reward it earns EWTs.

        <em>Figure 2: MoBat Use Case</em>
</p>

This use case illustrates one possible scenario on how to make use of services related to EVs. In particular, EV profiling and V2G services that enable e-scooter drivers (i.e. prosumers) to perform direct P2P transactions.
MoBat proposes a dApp and a smart contract architecture for the integration of a blockchain-boosted smart AI charging transaction, that will be implemented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of this solution. E-scooters and buildings (owners) in the MoBat scenario depict a node in the blockchain (i.e. EWC) network, holding a digital wallet with EWTs. For each e-scooter, the custom smart contract triggers the charging transaction process, based on the driver's profile, selecting the best scheme (in terms of cost and energy needs) to do so. With that in mind, the following steps are followed:

1.  An e-scooter (e-scooter A) can trigger a charging transaction at any time, at any place by simply connecting the portable battery (portable battery A) to the nearest geographic charging location (portable battery B).
2.  As soon as the physical link is made, e-scooter A requests a secure authorization via the blockchain network (the EW-Chain). 
3.  When the authorization link is established the digital e-scooter (e-scooter A) wallet will transfer a number of tokens (EWTs) to the payment service's dedicated smart contract (payment service between e-scooter A and B). 
4.  The transaction is validated as escrow by the consensus mechanism on the blockchain, and the smart contract locks in the payment. Charging is facilitated upon recognition of this information from the blockchain ledger. 
5.  The e-scooter (e-scooter A) requests that the transfer of energy from the portable battery (portable battery B) be started and that the energy transaction information be forwarded to the smart contract. In this way, the blockchain can logs valid and time-stamped information about the charging process. 
6.  The portable battery (portable battery B) begins the transfer of energy to the e-scooter (e-scooter A) as soon as it identifies the transaction that was validated by the blockchain. 
7.  If the battery (battery A) is fully loaded, or the e-scooter driver wishes to abort, the e-scooter (e-scooter A) requests a termination of the energy transfer.


### Relation to Energy Web’s mission

The MoBat project is a direct response to Energy Web Challenge priorities as these are set to further addresses the major societal challenge that is concerned with climate action, enabled a greener environment, and achieve resource efficiency with the use of emerging technologies, i.e. blockchain. Furthermore, the expected impacts from the MoBat project are directly aligned with the mission of Energy Web which acts as an enabled to innovation in the context of low carbon energy systems.
* **Decarbonization:** The technology provided by MoBat (i.e., e-scooters and portable batteries) aims to play a crucial role as a an efficient, cost-effective and affordable solution for the EV charging in the smart mobility ecosystem. It will thereby directly help the adoption of EV (especially e-scooters), decrease CO2 emissions, and help decarbonization. The proposed AI enabled charging schemes aim to enable optimized pricing models, incentivised new ones, and to minimize the carbon footprint.
* **Blockchain for Decentralization:** The MoBat philosophy looks to further promote decentralization of energy with innovative P2P schemes enabled by the use of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology provides to the consumers an alternative scheme for interchanging energy with the opportunity to eliminate mediators, at the same time allowing groups and individuals to directly negotiate and exchange energy between them. With MoBat, e-scooter drivers are becoming prosumers with storing energy in their portable batteries, trade energy with others (in near geographical areas) or make it available for charging when they are not using them.  In a MoBat network, the e-scooter driver calculates the charging rate, and the blockchain verifies the charging fee and conducts the payment digitally in a decentralized and transparent way. The MoBat decentralized network can provide a secure, transparent and decentralized ledger of all data and transactions relating to energy production and consumption during charging. Moreover, smart contracts can promote the interconnection between prosumers and/or provide a direct link between energy suppliers and energy consumers, leading to the decentralisation of current energy systems.
* **Expanded Market Access:** Within the MoBat network EVs can be considered as a mobile energy storage, due to their potential for storage and flexible demand. With technology improvements, growing investment in the field and decreasing prices of batteries, the annual EV sales are projected to grow by 30%  between 2020 and 2030 [69]. Although, the adoption of smart portable e-scooter batteries can bring additional flexibility to the energy grid by shifting charging to low demand periods, “Grid-to-Vehicle” (G2V) operation or by discharging power from their battery during peak hours “Vehicle-to-Grid” (V2G) operation. Thus, the participation of EV drivers in the energy grid is maximized, acting both as energy consumers and as energy producers.

* **Participation in Energy Projects**:

    * ***PARITY - Pro-sumer AwaRe, Transactive Markets for Valorization of Distributed flexibilITY enabled by Smart Energy Contracts:*** PARITY addresses the “structural inertia” of existing distribution grids by delivering a transactive grid & market framework that will increase the durability and efficiency of the electrical grid and facilitate the penetration of RES beyond 50% of the generation mix in the distribution network.

    * ***SINGULAR (DR 2.0 in Microgrids over DSI in real-time):*** A large share of the recent renewable energy sources (RES) installed capacity has already taken place in insular electricity grids, since these regions are preferable due to their high RES potential. SINGULAR investigates the effects of large-scale integration of renewables and demand-side management on the planning and operation of insular (non-interconnected) electricity grids, proposing efficient measures, solutions and tools towards the development of a sustainable and smart grid. Different network operation procedures and tools, based on innovative approaches of predictive electricity network operation, will be developed. The goal is the generation of effective solutions and information so that the integration of insular and highly variable energy resources is maximized. The operation and planning tools and procedures will be applied in different insular electricity grids in five countries across Europe for extensive demonstration, allowing the development of generalized guides of procedures and grid codes specific for future generation of smart insular electricity grids. 

    * ***VIMSEN: Virtual Microgrids for Smart Energy Networks:*** The subsidy feed in tariff policy, which has been recently adopted for accelerating renewable energy investments, cannot be retained as a sustainable business model for the future smart energy grid. This is mainly due to the fact that this policy increases the energy cost, especially when the amount of the energy generated by renewable sources is not negligible compared to the traditional ones, as is expected for the near future. Additionally, the current centralized electricity market prevents small or very small energy producers, who usually generate energy by renewable means-photovoltaic units or wind turbines- to participate. VIMSEN addresses the aforementioned difficulties by transforming the current centralized electricity market framework to a distributed one, introducing the concept of virtual micro-grid networks. Virtual micro-grids (VMGs) are associations of distributed energy generators and/or micro-grid networks, which they have been agreed to operate on a common basis. VMGs provides flexibility to small or very small energy generators, since, i) they can re-distribute energy resources with each other to compensate energy production-distribution and ii) they can directly participate in the electricity market through the respective association, which acts similarly as a big power generator unit. VIMSEN researches i) on an intelligent data metering techniques suitable for the VMG distributed network, ii) on information and decision making technologies for the dynamic VMG creation in a way to optimize participant benefits and macro-grid perspectives, iii) on a reliable communication infrastructure that permits QoS provisioning for data exchange in the VMG network and iv) on an active energy management and control tool for the operation of the virtual micro-grid as a common virtual power unit. Business models to investigate the trade-off between the benefits of the association and the cost of the technologies needed to establish the VMG network.
